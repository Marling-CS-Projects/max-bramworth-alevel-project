# 2.2.2 Cycle 2 - adding controls

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I will create and input system that registers inputs in a way that is better than the default JavaScript key detections and also allows for full re-mapping. Then I will create the controls to move around, forwards, backwards and side to side. Finally I will allow the player to rotate the camera all the way round left and right but clamp the movement up and down.

* [x] Create a set of variables that track which keys are down
* [x] Track mouse movements and clicks
* [x] Assign the keys to actions
  * [x] WASD will default to moving
  * [x] Movement will be relative to the camera's rotation

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           |
