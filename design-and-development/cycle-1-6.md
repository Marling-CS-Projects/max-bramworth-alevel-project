# Cycle 6 - Combat

## Design

* [x] Add damageable enemies
* [x] Add a system for quickly adding new attacks to the game
* [x] Allow the player to attack
  * [x] This should prevent other animations
  * [ ] Attacks should have some wind up to them
* [ ] Damageable enemies and objects are removed from the scene when they lose all of their hit points

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| foo           | does something useful |

## Development

### Outcome

This cycle is important because it's mechanics are the main focus point of my game. I started by creating two classes, Something to damage and something to damage with. Combatants will be enemies and they&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Main.js" %}
```
class Combatant {
  constructor(model, hp, spd, detec, acuteDetec, attacks, name){
    this.name = name;
    this.model = model;
    this.hp = hp;
    this.speed = spd;
    this.attacks = attacks;
    this.state = "neutral";
    this.detectionDistance = detec;
    this.acuteDetctionDistance = acuteDetec;
    combatants.push(this);
    this.wasHit = false;
  }
}

class attack {
  constructor(windup, duration, total_angle, hitbox_radius, hitbox_points, damage, stun){
    this.windUp = windup;
    this.duration = duration;
    this.totalAngle = total_angle;
    this.hitboxDRadius = hitbox_radius;
    this.hitboxPoints = hitbox_points;
    this.hitbox = new THREE.Box3(new THREE.Vector3(), new THREE.Vector3());
    this.damage = damage;
    this.stun = stun;
    this.hasHit = [];
  }

  sweep(user, sweep_angle){ // called once per frame by attacking object
    user.rotation.y += sweep_angle - (this.totalAngle / 2); // rotate to angle
    let startVector = new THREE.Vector3(); // create vector
    user.getWorldDirection(startVector); // set it to new direction
    user.rotation.y -= sweep_angle - (this.totalAngle / 2); // reset rotation
    let _Points = [];
    this.hitboxPoints.forEach(point => {
      _Points.push(new THREE.Vector3(user.position.x + startVector.x * point, user.position.y + startVector.y * point, user.position.z + startVector.z * point));
    })
    combatants.forEach(combatant => {
      _Points.forEach(_point => {
        if (MATHS.distance(_point, combatant.model._pos) < this.hitboxDRadius && !MATHS.arrayContains(this.hasHit, combatant.name)){
          console.log("he got jimmy jammed à¶ž");
          this.hasHit.push(combatant.name);
        }
      })
    })
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maths.js" %}
```
export function arrayContains(array, item){ // not very mathsy but i can't think of a bette place to put it
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if (array[i] == item){
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
