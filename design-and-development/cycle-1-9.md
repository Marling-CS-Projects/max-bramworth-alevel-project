# 2.2.9 Cycle 9 - Combat IV        (Player Death)

### Design

The player needs to be able fail or the game will not have any stakes. The player also needs to be able to keep playing however so that they can give encounters another go. Having respawn points be something the player has to physically seek out encourages exploration and means they can be used as a reward for surpassing a certain challenge. If respawn points are too spaced out the game will feel unfair, too generous will make the game trivial.

## Objectives
