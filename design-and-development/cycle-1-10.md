# 2.2.10 Cycle 10 - Main Menu

### Design

A main menu is required for my game as it will mean that the player is not immediately thrown into the game upon starting it up. Additionally, many players expect there to be a start menu and will be confused if one is not present.

## Objectives

* [x] Have a start menu
  * [ ] Allow it to launch the main game
* [ ] Have the menu be visually appealing
  * [x] Has title of the game
  * [ ] Has some sort of artwork related to the game
  * [ ] Should have some music to set the atmosphere of the game
