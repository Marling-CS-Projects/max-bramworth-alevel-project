# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

These tests will be the main tests from each of the cycles. Some smaller tests (e.g. retests) will be left out and the tests in cycle 0 will not be done because that experimental cycle did not affect the final product.

## Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect           | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------------------- | --------- |
| 1.1  | Do thing     | What success looks like | Pass      |
