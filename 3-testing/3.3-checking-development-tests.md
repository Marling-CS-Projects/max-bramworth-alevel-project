# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

These tests will be the main tests from each of the cycles. Some smaller tests (e.g. retests) will be left out and the tests in cycle 0 will not be done because that experimental cycle did not affect the final product. Additionally, some tests will be modified as they were originally testing non-final assets (e.g. the dev cube in 1.1 no longer exists).

## Tests

| Test | Instructions                 | What I expect                                   | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1.1  | Run code                     | See menu, no errors in console                  | Pass      |
| 2.3  | Move mouse in game           | Camera moves around                             |           |
| 2.4  | Move mouse and press W/A/S/D | Player moves around in direction of the camera. |           |
