# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

A complete set of tests should be run to assess the final solution.

These tests will be the main tests from each of the cycles. Some smaller tests (e.g. retests) will be left out and the tests in cycle 0 will not be done because that experimental cycle did not affect the final product. Additionally, some tests will be modified as they were originally testing non-final assets (e.g. the dev cube in 1.1 no longer exists).

## Tests

| 1.1 | Run code | See menu, no errors in console | Pass |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ---- |

| 2.3 | Move mouse in game           | Camera moves around                             |   |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | - |
| 2.4 | Move mouse and press W/A/S/D | Player moves around in direction of the camera. |   |

| 3.2 | Walk into a wall | Player cannot move into the wall |   |
| --- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | - |

| 4.1 | Load game scene      | All 3D models correctly load             |   |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | - |
| 4.2 | Walk into a 3D Model | Player cannot move into it's tube hitbox |   |

| 5.1 | Press space                       | Player moves upwards, then gradually returns to ground                       |   |
| --- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| 5.2 | Jump to a higher elevation        | As above, with a lower velocity before the player touches the ground         |   |
| 5.3 | Jump to a lower elevation         | As above, with a higher velocity before the player touches the ground        |   |
| 5.4 | Press left shift for a short time | Player rolls in direction of camera quickly, but for a finite amount of time |   |
| 5.5 | Hold left shift                   | Player can move as normal, but faster                                        |   |
