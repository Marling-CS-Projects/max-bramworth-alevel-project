# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the player know where to go? Do the enemies telegraph their attacks well? Can the player tell the attack from the telegraph? |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the menus fast? Are loading times short? Does the player feel like they can efficiently move around the world?                |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the player challenged? Are they enjoying themselves? Does the boss challenge their skills?                                     |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Were any bugs encountered? How severe were they? was the game able to be skipped?                                                 |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the controls intuitive and easy to control? Did they feel restraining and small or too large and intimidating?               |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

### Effective

The players clearly display here that they do enjoy exploring the world. This is good because it shows that exploring the (fairly linear) world was not frustrating to navigate.

> I observed that many players had to search for the lever in the first area, after becoming confused as to why all paths forward were blocked. Once they found it, which was usually aided by the placement of the enemies, it was smooth sailing to the boss room.

There was also plenty of agreement that the separate areas of the game all looked different. Although the game area was small, this principle of having different looking areas will have aided players in their navigation, preventing accidental back tracking.

> I only observed one player accidentally backtrack, and he realised it quickly when he saw the stone brick of the capital chapel, proving that the areas were helping navigation.

### Efficient

Player sentiment about the menu agreed it was easy to use with one outlier rating it a 6. This shows that the menu was effective to use and did not confuse players

> No players showed difficulties with the menu during testing

The player base seemed more divided on the topic of waiting times. Most players rated 7 and above however which tells me that they did not feel the time got in the way of playing the game.

> Many players, while filling out the survey, asked if they could replay to re-experience the loading time as they had forgotten about it. This also indicates to me that the players did not notice or did not care about the loading time, feeling it did not impede them.

Sluggish was a common response to the feelings of the controls, meaning that the players felt that the controls felt to the players like they lagged behind the inputs. This could likely be fact that the attack animations . It could also be in the way the jump feels to control or due to the delay in the roll that was present.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5         | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone. |
| 6         | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                  |
| 8         | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                     |
| 15        | The player wants to explore the world and enjoys roaming it.                                                                              |
