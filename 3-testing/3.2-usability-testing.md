| 1 - Effective      | Does the player know where to go? Do the enemies telegraph their attacks well? Can the player tell the attack from the telegraph? |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the menus fast? Are loading times short? Does the player feel like they can efficiently move around the world?                |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the player challenged? Are they enjoying themselves? Does the boss challenge their skills?                                     |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Were any bugs encountered? How severe were they? was the game able to be skipped?                                                 |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the controls intuitive and easy to control? Did they feel restraining and small or too large and intimidating?               |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation
