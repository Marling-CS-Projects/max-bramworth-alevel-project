# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Does the player know where to go? Can the player navigate well? Is the UI readable?                                 |
| 2 - Efficient      | Are the menus fast? Are loading times short? Does the player feel like they can efficiently move around the world?  |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the player challenged? Are they enjoying themselves? Does the boss challenge their skills?                       |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Were any bugs encountered? How severe were they? was the game able to be skipped?                                   |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Were the controls intuitive and easy to control? Did they feel restraining and small or too large and intimidating? |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

## User Feedback

### Effective

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The players clearly display here that they do enjoy exploring the world. This is good because it shows that exploring the (fairly linear) world was not frustrating to navigate.

> I observed that many players had to search for the lever in the first area, after becoming confused as to why all paths forward were blocked. Once they found it, which was usually aided by the placement of the enemies, it was smooth sailing to the boss room.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (4) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There was also plenty of agreement that the separate areas of the game all looked different. Although the game area was small, this principle of having different looking areas will have aided players in their navigation, preventing accidental back tracking.

> I only observed one player accidentally backtrack, and he realised it quickly when he saw the stone brick of the capital chapel, proving that the areas were helping navigation.

The game's UI consists of a single health bar, and sometimes a boss health bar. The players have agreed that this was very easy to read.

> None of the players were briefed on the purpose of any of the elements of the UI yet all figured it out almost instantly. I received feedback that the flaws of the UI was that the players expected certain elements that were hidden from them not to be hidden such as enemy health.

### Efficient

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Player sentiment about the menu agreed it was easy to use with the lowest rating of a 6. This shows that the menu was effective to use and did not confuse players

> No players showed difficulties with the menu during testing.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The player base seemed more divided on the topic of waiting times. Most players rated 7 and above however which tells me that they did not feel the time got in the way of playing the game.

> Many players, while filling out the survey, asked if they could replay to re-experience the loading time as they had forgotten about it. This also indicates to me that the players did not notice or did not care about the loading time, feeling it did not impede them.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Sluggish was a common response to the feelings of the controls, meaning that the players felt that the controls felt to the players like they lagged behind the inputs. This could likely be fact that the attack animations . It could also be in the way the jump feels to control or due to the delay in the roll that was present.

> Some players felt that they were being punished for attacking by not being able to move at the same time. This was not a common sentiment however.

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each of the enemies aroused their own common reactions. Unfortunately the enemies were generally agreed to feel rather unintelligent which may damage player engagement.

> The simplistic tactics of enemies to run at the player and attack justifies this response. Although this makes sense for lesser enemies, enemies that were supposed to feel more intelligent should have been give a more advanced AI.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The starter enemy, undead fishermen, were described as non-threatening. I wanted all enemies to come across as potentially life-threatening but this clearly was not the case for the fishermen. It might have been their inclusion alongside stronger enemies that made the players think of them comparatively as weak. In my opinion however, the undead fishermen were still a success as they were able to teach player how to approach combat on a target that they did not feel overly intimidated by.

> I did observe a few players get hit by an attack from a fisherman, and the stun caused them to be hit by something more damaging. So the fishermen were not completely useless, even killing a few players when they had just picked up the game.

The next enemy the player encounters, fallen templar, brought a very mixed reaction. This shows to me that they may have been well balanced for the player base, with the fluctuations in the responses coming from those who were higher or lower on the skill curve. However, they only received 1 response stating that they were engaging to partake in combat with. I am of firm belief therefore that the fallen templar enemy was a success.

> Many players mistook the lone templar in the chapel after the gate as the boss. During observation, many players also showed awareness of the templar's range of attacks, stating how the spin attack was dangerous and require the player to make distance. One most common comment was that attacks could not de differentiated by their wind up.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The giant appears in an area the player has already been through and is supposed to feel like a clumsy giant, attacking with anger and savagery rather than using training in weaponry. Common sentiment agreed with me, stating that he was slow, yet dangerous. I believe that this shows the players thought of him as a threat, but one with exploitable weaknesses that the player felt they could exploit. Therefore the giant enemy was a success.

> The giant was the most commonly avoided enemy in the whole game, likely due to his sluggish telegraphs and slow move speed, as well as players just wanting to get to the final boss.

The final challenge of the game, Ulurich, the last king, had a positive reception. Only one tester said that the fight was too hard, with the rest describing him as being engaging to fight against. I believe this may be due to a selection of factors. Ulurich has the largest selection of attacks in the game and they have much more identity in their wind up. He also is the only enemy in the game that the player knows the health of, allowing the player to track their progress. This reception absolutely confirms to me that Ulurich, the last king, was a success.

> Ulurich's balance is a harder question to answer. Some players were unable to beat him while the other half of the players were able to 'cheese' him by running around the arena and making him chase them. One suggestion I received that I think may work is giving Ulurich some mobility options to dodge or catch the player.

The players showing that the controls generally felt good is nice but there were a few outliers. This means to me that the players generally enjoyed playing and thought the controls felt nice.

> During observation, all of the players seemed comfortable using the controls.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

All players found out that they could run past enemies rather easily, which did not break the game. I was hoping that the player would be able to play the game in whatever manner they choose: hunting down every last enemy or running past all of them, meaning that this was successful.

> Players usually started by thinking that they had to kill all of the enemies in the areas to progress but would generally stop fighting once they figured out it was not necessary.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The players found a wide range of bugs, showing that the game was pretty buggy. Many of which I already knew about but some were completely new to me.

> The players, much to my discouragement, seemed happy to exploit bugs to glitch into areas early or make fights ridiculously easy. No players had any crashes which meant that the game was stable which was good.

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The controls were unanimously named easy to learn and also had a wide variety in the player character's move set. This was the exact balance that I wanted to achieve so this was a massive success.

> None of the players showed difficulty using or understanding the controls during testing. A few forgot that they had a heavy attack.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5         | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone. |
| 6         | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                  |
| 8         | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                     |
| 15        | The player wants to explore the world and enjoys roaming it.                                                                              |
| 22        | The game fits a Pegi age rating of 12                                                                                                     |

### Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The players were very divided on their change in tactics between enemies. The average response for this was 5.5 so there was generally some change in tactics, which for a limited enemy type count of four, I am happy with - therefore I consider this criterion a <mark style="background-color:green;">success</mark>.

> The players would usually devolve with time into a strategy of just running past all of the enemies or of repeatedly pressing left click. I believe that more work should have been done to change the way players approach different enemies.

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Responses calling enemies too weak or too strong were rare. This tells me that the game was not too challenging.

> Observations showed me that players were not getting frustrated which confirms to me that this criterion was a <mark style="background-color:green;">success</mark>.

### Criterion 8

The giant and boss were both described as dangerous, with the other enemies generally being regarded as not a threat. I would have preferred if the other enemies were also seen as potentially threatening.

> In observations, the 'lesser' enemies (undead fishermen and fallen templar) were able to kill players frequently, despite not being rated as highly. This could be the players rating the enemies more empirically than emotionally, stating that these enemies physically had lower numbers with their response. I therefore still consider this criterion a <mark style="background-color:green;">success</mark>.

### Criterion 15

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Players said that they did enjoy exploring in general which was good and makes this criterion a <mark style="background-color:green;">success.</mark>

> None of the players showed frustration from exploring in my observations.

### Criterion 22

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players were in agreement that the game was <mark style="background-color:green;">success</mark>fully appropriate for ages 12. Only one participant said that it was not, stating a suggestion of 16. The violence is not detailed and not realistic so perhaps the source of this response was due to the overall themes of death and decay, featuring locations like swamps and degraded capitals. The visual design of enemies may also have contributed such as the visibly rotting undead fishermen and giants or Ulurich, who has spears sticking through his torso.

> No players expressed any sort of shock or concern over the design of enemies or with the age rating of the game.
