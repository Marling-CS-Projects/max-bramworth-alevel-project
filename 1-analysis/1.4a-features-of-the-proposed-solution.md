# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Core Mechanics

### Movement / Controls

The player will be able to run and walk in all directions \[WASD] and move the camera \[mouse move] to look in different directions. They will also be able to lock the camera onto a target \[q] (e.g. an enemy) so that they will always face them. This will make moving around the world easier as 3D games can often be harder to traverse than 2D games. The player will be able to hold run \[shift] in order to move faster or tap run to get a burst of speed which is faster than running but only is active for a short time and cannot be rapidly pressed.

### Enemies

Enemies will be able to harm the player if the player stands in their attack. They will always try to attack the player while the player is close enough to them. They will navigate to the player around obstacles and attack when in range. They will have health that the player can deplete and they die when they reach 0, causing them to become inactive and sometimes give the player an item that they can use.&#x20;

### Combat

Players and Enemies will both use a combat system where attacks are made and tied to an animation. When the animation is in the damaging part of the animation, anybody in the damaging are will be injured for a set amount of damage. The player will also be able to block attacks meaning they take much less damage from attacks while blocking but are slower and cannot attack or dodge.

### Saving Progress

The player will be able to save their progress along with all the items they have collected  so that they can continue from where they left off without having to replay lots of content. Players will be able to save only at certain spots in the world to prevent players from cheating encounters or immediately saving after every encounter. When the player saves, enemies will only respawn if their encounter was not finished but encounters that had had all their enemies defeated will not respawn.

## Limitations

### Web-Based

Being web based means that my product will only be able to be played on PC as browser applications are not supported my mobile or consoles. Additionally the performance of my game may be limited by the browser itself as different browsers do not run as well and having other tabs open may mean that my game has to share resources and processing power with other tabs in the browser.
