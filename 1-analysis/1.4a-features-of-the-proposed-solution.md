# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Core Mechanics

### Movement

The player will be able to run and walk in all directions and move the camera to look in different directions. They will also be able to lock the camera onto a target (e.g. an enemy) so that they will always face them. This will make moving around the world easier as 3D games can often be harder to traverse than 2D games. The player will be able to hold run in order to move faster or tap run to get a burst of speed which is faster than running but only is active for a short time and cannot be rapidly pressed.

### Enemies

### Combat

### Saving Progress

## World

### Linear Open World

### Set Encounters

### Bosses

### Secret Items / Encounters

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
