# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Core Mechanics

### Movement / Controls

The player will be able to run and walk in all directions \[WASD] and move the camera \[mouse move] to look in different directions. They will also be able to lock the camera onto a target \[q] (e.g. an enemy) so that they will always face them. This will make moving around the world easier as 3D games can often be harder to traverse than 2D games. The player will be able to hold run \[shift] in order to move faster or tap run to get a burst of speed which is faster than running but only is active for a short time and cannot be rapidly pressed.

### Enemies

Enemies will be able to harm the player if the player stands in their attack. They will always try to attack the player while the player is close enough to them. They will navigate to the player around obstacles and attack when in range. They will have health that the player can deplete and they die when they reach 0, causing them to become inactive and sometimes give the player an item that they can use.&#x20;

### Combat

Players and Enemies will both use a combat system where attacks are made and tied to an animation. When the animation is in the damaging part of the animation, anybody in the damaging are will be injured for a set amount of damage. The player will also be able to block attacks meaning they take much less damage from attacks while blocking but are slower and cannot attack or dodge.
