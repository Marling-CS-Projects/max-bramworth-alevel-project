# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Core Mechanics

### Movement / Controls

The player will be able to run and walk in all directions \[WASD] and move the camera \[mouse move] to look in different directions. They will also be able to lock the camera onto a target \[q] (e.g. an enemy) so that they will always face them. This will make moving around the world easier as 3D games can often be harder to traverse than 2D games. The player will be able to hold run \[shift] in order to move faster or tap run to get a burst of speed which is faster than running but only is active for a short time and cannot be rapidly pressed.

### Enemies

Enemies will be able to harm the player if the player stands in their attack. They will always try to attack the player while the player is close enough to them. They will navigate to the player around obstacles and attack when in range. They will have health that the player can deplete and they die when they reach 0, causing them to become inactive and sometimes give the player an item that they can use.
