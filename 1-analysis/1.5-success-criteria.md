| 1        | Game runs smoothly and consistently. Does not crash and is consistent in frame rate of 30fps.                                            | It will frustrate the player if their experience is constantly interrupted by crashes or frame rates, making them angry                                          | [1.4b](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |
| 2        | Keyboard and mouse inputs \[w, a, s, d, q, space, escape, left shift, mouse move, left click, right click] are responsive and consistent | The Player will also get frustrated if their inputs are not always consistently being read and it will add randomness to gameplay.                               | [1.4b](1.4b-computational-methods.md) |

| 5        | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  | If the player can repeat the same attacks over and over the game will quickly become boring.                                                                                          | [Combat](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#combat)   |

| 7        | The game has a variety of enemies (with variety in mechanics and visual design) and enemy encounters.                                                                      | If all the enemies are the same then the game will feel boring and the player will not feel excited to see a new enemy.                                                               | [Enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies) |
| 8        | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                                                      | If some enemies are push overs, the player will not have to think for some of the game                                                                                                | [Enemies](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#enemies) |
| 9        | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        | Having a simple, underlying combat mechanic that the player is able to apply to all combat scenarios makes combat easier to grasp and will just confuse the player if not consistent. | [Combat](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#combat)   |
| 10       | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 | Adding equipment to the game allows the Player to get stronger as the game progresses and makes them feel like they are discovering                                                   | [Inventory](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#items) |
| 11       | Player can only have one of each type of item equipped. The item the player has equipped in each slot (weapon, armour, head, waist) gives different bonuses to the player. | Only allowing the player to have one type of each item equipped forces them to make choices about what items are best for an upcoming encounter.                                      | [Inventory](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#items) |

| 12      | World has walls that the player can walk on and collide with that limit the player's movement.                                                                   | The player can only walk round in a specified area as otherwise they may get stuck out of bounds.                                               | [Movement](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#movement-controls) |
| 13      | The world is easy to navigate with different parts having different visual identities. Path forwards is intuitive but doesn't feel like your hand is being held. | The Player will get frustrated if the world is hard to navigate and may quit if they feel as if the game is holding their hand with navigation. | [World](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#linear-open-world)    |
| 14      | There are multiple routes in certain sections.                                                                                                                   | Having multiple routes increases replayability and makes the path to follow more interesting.                                                   | [World](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#linear-open-world)    |

| 17      | Game can be saved, creating a file on the computer which the game can read to restore that game state at any time. | The player may not have time to play the whole game in one sitting so being able to take a break and come back to the game in the same spot will save time. | [Saving](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#saving)                                                                         |

| 20      | Inventory UI is neatly and logically laid out. The player can find out what items do easily.                       | The player will need to be changing items so they will need to be able to know what they do and how to equip them.                                          | [Inventory](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#items)                                                                       |
| 21      | Game menu is pleasing to look at.                                                                                  | The menu is the first thing the player will see on launch, so it should entice them to play                                                                 | [Title Screen](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#title-screen)                                                             |
