| 1        | Game runs smoothly and consistently. Does not crash and is consistent in frame rate.                                                     | It will frustrate the player if their experience is constantly interrupted by crashes or frame rates, making them angry                                          |           |
| 2        | Keyboard and mouse inputs \[w, a, s, d, q, space, escape, left shift, mouse move, left click, right click] are responsive and consistent | The Player will also get frustrated if their inputs are not always consistently being read and it will add randomness to gameplay.                               |           |
| 3        | Game can run on majority of modern devices and browsers                                                                                  | I want the game to be playable by as many people as possible.                                                                                                    |           |
|          | Game is consistent between devices, regardless of Hardware Spec and Internet Browser.                                                    | If the game acts differently depending on hardware then it is making the game worse for players for reasons out of their control, making their experience worse. |           |

### Gameplay

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.

|          | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  | If the player can repeat the same attacks over and over the game will quickly become boring.                                                                                          |           |
|          | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                                                   | The game will be the most fun if the player feels a sense of danger from all the encounters but if it feels unfairly hard then the player will just quit.                             |           |
|          | The game has a variety of enemies (with variety in mechanics and visual design) and enemy encounters.                                                                      | If all the enemies are the same then the game will feel boring and the player will not feel excited to see a new enemy.                                                               |           |
|          | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        | Having a simple, underlying combat mechanic that the player is able to apply to all combat scenarios makes combat easier to grasp and will just confuse the player if not consistent. |           |
|          | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 | Adding equipment to the game allows the Player to get stronger as the game progresses and makes them feel like they are discovering                                                   |           |
|          | Player can only have one of each type of item equipped. The item the player has equipped in each slot (weapon, armour, head, waist) gives different bonuses to the player. | Only allowing the player to have one type of each item equipped forces them to make choices about what items are best for an upcoming encounter.                                      |           |

|         | World has walls that the player can walk on and collide with that limit the player's movement.                                                                   |               |           |
|         | The world is easy to navigate with different parts having different visual identities. Path forwards is intuitive but doesn't feel like your hand is being held. |               |           |
|         | There are multiple routes in certain sections.                                                                                                                   |               |           |
|         | The player wants to explore the world and enjoys roaming it.                                                                                                     |               |           |
