| Feature                                    | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player Controlled Camera                   | The player will need to be able to move the camera so that they can have it looking where they need to see what they need to see.                                                                                                                               |
| Lock-On Option                             | Enemies can often move around too quickly for the player to track and time spent aiming at the enemy can be annoying and break the flow of gameplay. A lock-on option means the camera will always face a selected target adding quality of life to the player. |
| Wide variety of controls                   | While more casual games opt to use simple controls that can be picked up easily by any player, more complicated controls allow for more depth of gameplay.                                                                                                      |
| Conditional Controls / Contextual Controls | This makes it more simple to play, allowing a small amount of buttons to make a large amount of inputs. For example: left shift to sprint, left shift while sprinting to jump.                                                                                  |
| Enemies                                    | The core obstacle of all souls-like games, they provide a constant challenge that the difficulty of is easily adjustable.                                                                                                                                       |
| Enemy loot                                 | Provides a reward and an incentive to fight enemies, drawing the player to where the fun is.                                                                                                                                                                    |
{% endtab %}

| Feature            | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Respawning Enemies | Having infinitely respawning enemies means the player has to go through encounters that they have already done when it is no longer a challenge, this can be annoying and potentially lead to the layer being able to 'farm' enemies for infinite loot. |
