## Dark Souls 3

Images are nice here...

### Overview

The Third instalment in the series that defines the 'souls-like' genre, Dark Souls 3 was developed primarily for PlayStation consoles by From Software and was published by Konami. The series is famed for its difficulty because it was designed around making the player feel proud after overcoming incredible odds.

### Controls

Dark Souls 3 uses a very traditional melee combat system of light attacks, faster animation with less damage; heavy attacks, slower animations with more damage, blocks and dodges. The game's controls really shine when they combine together such as how actions can be 'queued' while another animation is playing to instantly use once that animation is finished, chained attacks play faster - encouraging aggressive yet thought out behaviour and blocking an attack allows you to then perform a powerful parry on that enemy, dealing lots of damage in return.

### Enemy Design

In order to make the player feel a sense of challenge without just making the player quit, From Software designed the enemies and bosses to very clearly telegraph their attacks with animations in order to let the player react in time. This makes fights feel fair and when the player dies it helps them understand what they did wrong and how they can learn to beat that enemy next time. Dark Souls 3 also has a glooming, gothic theme which is reflected in the visual appearance of the enemies&#x20;

| Feature                                    | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player Controlled Camera                   | The player will need to be able to move the camera so that they can have it looking where they need to see what they need to see.                                                                                                                               |
| Lock-On Option                             | Enemies can often move around too quickly for the player to track and time spent aiming at the enemy can be annoying and break the flow of gameplay. A lock-on option means the camera will always face a selected target adding quality of life to the player. |
| Wide variety of controls                   | While more casual games opt to use simple controls that can be picked up easily by any player, more complicated controls allow for more depth of gameplay.                                                                                                      |
| Conditional Controls / Contextual Controls | This makes it more simple to play, allowing a small amount of buttons to make a large amount of inputs. For example: left shift to sprint, left shift while sprinting to jump.                                                                                  |
| Enemies                                    | The core obstacle of all souls-like games, they provide a constant challenge that the difficulty of is easily adjustable.                                                                                                                                       |
| Enemy loot                                 | Provides a reward and an incentive to fight enemies, drawing the player to where the fun is.                                                                                                                                                                    |

{% tab title="Features I won't Include" %}
| Feature                                 | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Respawning Enemies                      | Having infinitely respawning enemies means the player has to go through encounters that they have already done when it is no longer a challenge, this can be annoying and potentially lead to the layer being able to 'farm' enemies for infinite loot. |
| Easy Access Healing Item (Estus Flasks) | Healing items, such as Estus Flasks, cause the issue that they take the player out of the action in order to use because they take a while to use. This breaks the flow of combat which ruins the game feel.                                            |
| Large interconnected world map          | The World of Dark Souls is all interconnected and any part can be navigated to by any other part. Although this aids with navigation, I want players to have a more streamlined experience.                                                             |
