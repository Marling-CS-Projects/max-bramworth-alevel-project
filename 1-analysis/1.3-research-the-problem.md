## Dark Souls 3

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1).png>)

### Overview

The Third instalment in the series that defines the 'souls-like' genre, Dark Souls 3 was developed in 2016 primarily for PlayStation 4 by From Software and was published by Bandai Namco. The series is famed for its difficulty because it was designed around making the player feel proud after overcoming incredible odds.

### Controls

Dark Souls 3 uses a very traditional melee combat system of light attacks, faster animation with less damage; heavy attacks, slower animations with more damage, blocks and dodges. The game's controls really shine when they combine together such as how actions can be 'queued' while another animation is playing to instantly use once that animation is finished, chained attacks play faster - encouraging aggressive yet thought out behaviour and blocking an attack allows you to then perform a powerful parry on that enemy, dealing lots of damage in return.

### Items and Inventory

Dark Souls 3 has a wide array of items and equipment that the player is able to equip and use throughout their journey. This allows for a multitude of playstyles and gives a lot of customisation options to the player in order to perfect their 'build', it also combines with the 'Dungeons and Dragons' like attributes system that the game has which allows the player to be better at certain skills than others. As the game has no official difficulty settings, this allows the player to self regulate the difficulty by changing their strategy to their desired skill level. It is a lot easier to run from your enemy while pelting them with spells, for example, than to face them head on with a sword.

### Enemy Design

In order to make the player feel a sense of challenge without just making the player quit, From Software designed the enemies and bosses to very clearly telegraph their attacks with animations in order to let the player react in time. This makes fights feel fair and when the player dies it helps them understand what they did wrong and how they can learn to beat that enemy next time. Dark Souls 3 also has a glooming, gothic theme which is reflected in the visual appearance of the enemies, who are coloured in dark shades and in read and are decorated in medieval style armour

| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Player Controlled Camera                   | The player will need to be able to move the camera so that they can have it looking where they need to see what they need to see.                                                                                                                               |
| Lock-On Option                             | Enemies can often move around too quickly for the player to track and time spent aiming at the enemy can be annoying and break the flow of gameplay. A lock-on option means the camera will always face a selected target adding quality of life to the player. |
| Wide variety of controls                   | While more casual games opt to use simple controls that can be picked up easily by any player, more complicated controls allow for more depth of gameplay.                                                                                                      |
| Conditional Controls / Contextual Controls | This makes it more simple to play, allowing a small amount of buttons to make a large amount of inputs. For example: left shift to sprint, left shift while sprinting to jump.                                                                                  |
| Enemies                                    | The core obstacle of all souls-like games, they provide a constant challenge that the difficulty of is easily adjustable.                                                                                                                                       |
| Enemy loot                                 | Provides a reward and an incentive to fight enemies, drawing the player to where the fun is.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Respawning Enemies                      | Having infinitely respawning enemies means the player has to go through encounters that they have already done when it is no longer a challenge, this can be annoying and potentially lead to the layer being able to 'farm' enemies for infinite loot. |
| Easy Access Healing Item (Estus Flasks) | Healing items, such as Estus Flasks, cause the issue that they take the player out of the action in order to use because they take a while to use. This breaks the flow of combat which ruins the game feel.                                            |
| Large interconnected world map          | The World of Dark Souls is all interconnected and any part can be navigated to by any other part. Although this aids with navigation, I want players to have a more streamlined experience.                                                             |

## Metal Gear Rising: Revengence

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

### Overview

Metal Gear Rising: Revengence is a fast-paced hack and slash that deviates significantly from the rest of the metal gear series, which focuses mainly on stealth based gameplay. Metal Gear Rising was developed in 2013 by Platinum and published by Konami for PlayStation 3 and PC. It features a high-tech theme and has many features in place to make the player feel awesome.

### Controls

Standard keyboard controls are used with light attacks, heavy attacks and blocks. This simple yet wide range of controls gives the player a large set of options during combat, for example: should the player be greedy and try and land another attack or would it be safer to block. The game also features a mode used for destroying objects or finishing off enemies in which time comes to a near halt and the player can swing their sword in wide arcs across the screen, severing objects in half.

### Game Feel

In order to make the player feel like a robot ninja, Platinum used a variety of tricks to add a sense of speed and power to all actions. For a start, all animations are given a generous dosage of motion blur which makes them feel faster and shows their path of travel, adding weight to the motions causing them to feel more powerful. Raiden's attacks take up massive amounts of space on the screen, arcing across it to make them feel powerful.&#x20;

Players also receive a grade rating their performance at the end of every stage. This grade is based of factors, all of which directly rely on the player's skill alone, like highest combo achieved and number of hits taken. Instead of punishing the player for playing in a way that 'cheeses' encounters or is overly cowardly, it rewards those who play aggressively and takes risks - which is often the most fun way to play the game.

| 'Free Blade' Mode           | Performing a Free Blade attack makes the player feel awesome and wraps up fights in a way that satisfies the intensity gradient                                                                                                                    |
| Combo meter                 | A combo meter rewards the player for playing aggressively and taking risks. This adds to the game feel                                                                                                                                             |
| End of Stage Grade          | Positively reinforcing actions is better for convincing players to play in a certain way instead of negatively reinforcing other actions. Therefore an end of stage grade can be used to encourage players to play hitless or with a perfect combo |
| Fast / Aggressive Game Feel | I think that a fast paced game where the player feels that both them self and their enemy are powerful would be the most fun feel for my game.                                                                                                     |

| Large HUD                          | I feel like the large HUD that Metal Gear Rising has would simply get in the way of the player's view and would break immersion.                                                                                                     |

## Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

### Overview

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice was released in 2019 for PlayStation 4 and PC. It was developed by From Software and was published by Activision. Sekiro follows a lot of the usual tropes of souls-like games but introduces an Asian theme and a wider variety of gameplay including stealth and platforming.

### Controls

Standard keyboard controls for hack and slash games are used as well as a 'camera target' or 'lock on' feature. Sekiro also features several special moves such as special attacks, extra mobility options or special counters, one crowd favourite for example is the mikuri counter, which allows the player to step on an enemy's weapon, disabling their attacks and allowing for a strong counter attack. This broadened range of actions that the player can perform adds depth to combat which enhances the feel of combat.

### Stealth and Platforming

There are certain parts of Sekiro that cannot be beaten by just swinging your sword. One example is the Great White Spirit Snake boss that is far to large to take on normally and can instantly kill the player if they are careless. Instead, the player has to platform around the mountainside and stealth their way into a tent where they can ambush the snake, defeating it in one decisive strike to the eye.

Adding variety to the game makes it easier to pace the game by simply alternating high-intensity combat with some slower, more careful stealth sections.

### Special Gadgets

There are a multitude of special items that can be used by the Player in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Some have limited uses but are very useful in their uses: such as the fistful of ash, which is thrown to temporarily stun an enemy. Other items can be used for a multitude of scenarios such as the grappling hook which can be used in platforming to move around, stealth to find alternative pathways and in combat to grapple onto enemies and traverse the battlefield.

| Platforming                | Adding modes of play beyond just combat make the game more interesting and mechanics from platforming can extend into combat easily and vice versa                      |
| Alternate Mobility Options | Adding alternate ways to traverse the environment allows for more combat options and lets the player explore more places for secret items or rewards in their down time |
| Special Equipment          | Adding in equipable items with effects such as mobility or applying status effects allows for the player to experiment with builds and to try out different strategies  |
| Hidden Items               | Hiding items around the world out of the main path rewards the player for exploring.                                                                                    |
