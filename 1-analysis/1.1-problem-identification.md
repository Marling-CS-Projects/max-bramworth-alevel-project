# 1.1 Problem Identification

Through recent years, people's mental health has been taking a toll as due to the covid-19 pandemic. Although it is clearing up now, the effects on mental health are still noticeable as some people's mental health has declined. Key findings from reports have mentioned that there was a significant increase in mental health problems between before the pandemic and during it. It also showed that those of younger age more at risk. (World Health Organisation, 2022). This clearly shows that more mental health support will be needed for those of younger ages as they are more at risk, statistically. Therefore I will target the ages of 18-22 for my project.

To potentially combat the issues caused by the pandemic, video games have been offered as a solution. In a recent paper (Granic, Engels, 2022) the researchers found that some mental health benefits of playing video games (for moderate and controlled periods) included increased attention spans, heightened emotional resilience, improved social skills and better mood management in the experiment's volunteers. This could help to combat the types of issues that were found to be present in the WHO's study on mental health during lockdown which included issues such as depressions and anxiety both of which were common issues during and as a result of the pandemic (World Health Organisation, 2022).

Many people have turned to finding their own solutions to boredom for example, nearly half of America turned to video games during the pandemic (Farokhmanesh, 2021),&#x20;
