# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Players

## Demographics

Another reason I have for targeting the ages 18-22 is because my target platform, PC, is the most popular in this age bracket. A survey (GameTree, 2019) found that between the ages of 18-22, the age group preferences where drastically in favour of computers over all other platforms. This means that designing for the 18-22 age bracket on a computer will allow for the largest audience and therefore the highest player count. Therefore having a demographic of 18-22 will be beneficial.
