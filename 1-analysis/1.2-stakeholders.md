## Demographics

The main factor that constricts the demographics of my game is the PEGI rating system. This systems uses the content of a game in order to create guidelines for what ages it would be appropriate for.

My game will likely contain violence but if it is non-realistic or non-detailed then the game can still get at rating of 7. PEGI is recognised all across Europe.&#x20;

Another reason I have for targeting the ages 18-22 is because my target platform, PC, is the most popular in this age bracket. A survey (GameTree, 2019) found that between the ages of 18-22, the age group preferences where drastically in favour of computers over all other platforms. This means that designing for the 18-22 age bracket on a computer will allow for the largest audience and therefore the highest player count. Therefore having a demographic of 18-22 will be beneficial.

## Tending to the Player Base

&#x20;The recent market of Hack and Slash games is populated by multiple Souls-like that demand deliberate and precise inputs. Games of this sub-genre of Hack and Slash are shown to be incredibly popular with the people who play these games. For example Elden Ring sold a total of 13.4 million copies worldwide within a month of its initial release, however - it should be noted that this game was hyped up by its well-known developers for a long time, even winning an award for most anticipated game in 2020, and this was part of the reason for its great sales. My game will not have such hype but being in such a popular genres will hopefully make it appeal to more gamers.
