## Demographics

The main factor that constricts the demographics of my game is the PEGI rating system. This systems uses the content of a game in order to create guidelines for what ages it would be appropriate for.

My game will certainly contain violence but if it is non-realistic or non-detailed then the game can still get at rating of 7. PEGI is recognised all across Europe.&#x20;

Another reason I have for targeting the ages 18-22 is because my target platform, PC, is the most popular in this age bracket. A survey (GameTree, 2019) found that between the ages of 18-22, the age group preferences where drastically in favour of computers over all other platforms. This means that designing for the 18-22 age bracket on a computer will allow for the largest audience and therefore the highest player count. Therefore having a demographic of 18-22 will be beneficial.
