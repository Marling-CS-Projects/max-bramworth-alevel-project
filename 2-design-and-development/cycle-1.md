# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I will setup Kaboom.js and make sure I can locally host it. I will also create the foundations for the player's camera.

* [x] Successfully import Kaboom
* [x] Be able to locally host it on my computer
* [x] Have the Vertical and Horizontal positions of the objects on the camera represent a 3D view accurately
* [x] Let the player move back and forth and strafe side to side using keyboard input
* [x] Let the player move the camera around using the mouse&#x20;
