| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              | When was it achieved                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Game runs smoothly and consistently. Does not crash and is consistent in frame rate of minimum 60fps.                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 2         | Keyboard and mouse inputs \[w, a, s, d, q, space, escape, left shift, mouse move, left click, right click] are responsive and consistent | [Cycle 2 - Adding Controls](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md)   |
| 3         | Game can run on majority of modern devices and browsers                                                                                  | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 4         | Game is consistent between devices, regardless of Hardware Spec and Internet Browser.                                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |

### Criterion 1



Game runs at 120 fps normally, sometimes dips to 119 fps. This is very high and very consistent which definitely befits this criterion.

## Gameplay

| 5  | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-5) |

| 9  | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        | [Cycle 6 - Combat I](../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md)           |
| 10 | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 | Not achieved                                                           |
