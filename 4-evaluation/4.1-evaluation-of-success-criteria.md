## Gameplay

|    |                                                                                                                                                                            |   |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | - |
| 5  | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  |   |
| 6  | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                                                   |   |
| 7  | The game has a variety of enemies (with variety in mechanics and visual design) and enemy encounters.                                                                      |   |
| 8  | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                                                      |   |
| 9  | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        |   |
| 10 | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 |   |
| 11 | Player can only have one of each type of item equipped. The item the player has equipped in each slot (weapon, armour, head, waist) gives different bonuses to the player. |   |
