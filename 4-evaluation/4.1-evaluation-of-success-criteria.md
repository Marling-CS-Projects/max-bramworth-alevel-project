### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              | When was it achieved                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Game runs smoothly and consistently. Does not crash and is consistent in frame rate of minimum 60fps.                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 2         | Keyboard and mouse inputs \[w, a, s, d, q, space, escape, left shift, mouse move, left click, right click] are responsive and consistent | [Cycle 2 - Adding Controls](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md)   |
| 3         | Game can run on majority of modern devices and browsers                                                                                  | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 4         | Game is consistent between devices, regardless of Hardware Spec and Internet Browser.                                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Game runs at 120 fps normally, sometimes dips to 119 fps. This is very high and very consistent which definitely befits this criterion.

### Criterion 2

// vid of live playing

All keyboard inputs are instantly responsive and work consistently. The inputs respond when they should.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 3 & 4

I have included both 3 and 4 as they are evaluated at the same time.

The game has been tested extensively on Google Chrome and has worked flawlessly on Microsoft Edge. The game feels no faster or slower except for the loading time which is longer by about half a second on Edge.

## Gameplay

| 5  | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-5) |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6  | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                                                   | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-6) |
| 7  | The game has a variety of enemies (with variety in mechanics and visual design) and enemy encounters.                                                                      | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging)    |
| 8  | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                                                      | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-8) |
| 9  | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        | [Cycle 6 - Combat I](../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md)           |
| 10 | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 | Not achieved                                                           |
| 11 | Player can only have one of each type of item equipped. The item the player has equipped in each slot (weapon, armour, head, waist) gives different bonuses to the player. | Not achieved                                                           |

### Criterion 5

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-5) in my usability testing shows that the general opinion was that the players felt that they were changing their tactics between enemies.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 6

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-6) showed that players felt the game was sufficiently challenging but not frustrating, which I attribute to the weapon-accurate hitboxes and the large animations that show the player how they were hit.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 7

[This question ](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging)shows that the players was able to easily distinguish different enemies. This would have been done by weapon and size most likely, as the lighting made it hard to distinguish colours easily at distance.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 8

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-8) show some sentiment from players in agreement of this but during observation was when I saw that all enemies were able to be lethal to the player.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 9

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 10 & 11

I did not have time in development to begin working on the item system as I anticipated it would take a lot of time to get to good working standard that is on par with the rest of the game. Therefore both of these criterion were not even started.

## World

| 12 | World has walls that the player can walk on and collide with that limit the player's movement.                                                                   | [Cycle 3 - Collisions](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md)          |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13 | The world is easy to navigate with different parts having different visual identities. Path forwards is intuitive but doesn't feel like your hand is being held. | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-15) |
| 14 | There are multiple routes in certain sections.                                                                                                                   | [Cycle 11 - Content](../design-and-development/cycle-1-11.md)           |
| 15 | The player wants to explore the world and enjoys roaming it.                                                                                                     | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-15) |
| 16 | Parts of the world are locked off at the start and can only be unlocked by exploring for way to open them.                                                       | [Cycle 11 - Content](../design-and-development/cycle-1-11.md)           |

## Non-Gameplay

| 21 | Game menu is pleasing to look at.                                                                                  | [Cycle 10 - Main Menu & UI](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md)    |
