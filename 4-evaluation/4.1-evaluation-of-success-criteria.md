# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Functionality

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                              | When was it achieved                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | Game runs smoothly and consistently. Does not crash and is consistent in frame rate of minimum 60fps.                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 2         | Keyboard and mouse inputs \[w, a, s, d, q, space, escape, left shift, mouse move, left click, right click] are responsive and consistent | [Cycle 2 - Adding Controls](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md)   |
| 3         | Game can run on majority of modern devices and browsers                                                                                  | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |
| 4         | Game is consistent between devices, regardless of Hardware Spec and Internet Browser.                                                    | [Testing for Function and Robustness](../3-testing/3.1-robustness.md) |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Game runs at 120 fps normally, sometimes dips to 119 fps. This is very high and very consistent which definitely befits this criterion.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 2

// vid of live playing (recorded - no editing required)

All keyboard inputs are instantly responsive and work consistently. The inputs respond when they should.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 3 & 4

I have included both 3 and 4 as they are evaluated at the same time.

The game has been tested extensively on Google Chrome and has worked flawlessly on Microsoft Edge. The game feels no faster or slower except for the loading time which is longer by about half a second on Edge.

## Gameplay

| 5  | Game has no 'solution' to combat. Player must change their strategy between enemies and cannot expect the same trick to work on everyone.                                  | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-5) |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6  | Game is challenging but not frustrating.                                                                                                                                   | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-6) |
| 7  | The game has a variety of enemies (with variety in mechanics and visual design) and enemy encounters.                                                                      | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging)    |
| 8  | All the enemies are able to put the player in danger.                                                                                                                      | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-8) |
| 9  | The Player is able to defeat any enemy and be defeated by any enemy by depleting their health to 0.                                                                        | [Cycle 6 - Combat I](../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md)           |
| 10 | The Player can pick up items from the ground that are permanently stored in the inventory.                                                                                 | Not achieved                                                           |
| 11 | Player can only have one of each type of item equipped. The item the player has equipped in each slot (weapon, armour, head, waist) gives different bonuses to the player. | Not achieved                                                           |

### Criterion 5

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-5) in my usability testing shows that the general opinion was that the players felt that they were changing their tactics between enemies.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 6

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-6) showed that players felt the game was sufficiently challenging but not frustrating, which I attribute to the weapon-accurate hitboxes and the large animations that show the player how they were hit.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 7

[This question ](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging)shows that the players was able to easily distinguish different enemies. This would have been done by weapon and size most likely, as the lighting made it hard to distinguish colours easily at distance.&#x20;

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 8

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-8) show some sentiment from players in agreement of this but during observation was when I saw that all enemies were able to be lethal to the player.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 9

// vid of killing enemy (unrecorded)

The player is able to defeat every enemy by using the same attack system as the enemies use. This helps the player feel like they are engaging in combat against other combatants as opposed to clicking to make a number smaller.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 10 & 11

I did not have time in development to begin working on the item system as I anticipated it would take a lot of time to get to good working standard that is on par with the rest of the game. Therefore both of these criterion were not even started.

## World

| 12 | World has walls that the player can walk on and collide with that limit the player's movement.                                                                   | [Cycle 3 - Collisions](../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md)          |
| -- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13 | The world is easy to navigate with different parts having different visual identities. Path forwards is intuitive but doesn't feel like your hand is being held. | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-15) |
| 14 | There are multiple routes in certain sections.                                                                                                                   | [Cycle 11 - Content](../design-and-development/cycle-1-11.md)           |
| 15 | The player wants to explore the world and enjoys roaming it.                                                                                                     | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-15) |
| 16 | Parts of the world are locked off at the start and can only be unlocked by exploring for way to open them.                                                       | [Cycle 11 - Content](../design-and-development/cycle-1-11.md)           |

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The player is standing on top of the platform, instead of falling through</p></figcaption></figure>

Walls push the player out of them without any jittering, giving a good illusion of solid walls in the game that the player cannot move through.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 13

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#effective) and the observations I made of the players around it shows that the world was fairly intuitive to navigate. Players quickly picked up which routes were locked off and would open up later, as well as figuring out how to open them. Having a changing visual identity for the different sections and having whole sections open up at once helped players to navigate and figure out the path forwards.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The fastest path through the game</p></figcaption></figure>

The game is fairly linear but does have some opportunities for exploration such as in the starting area which is open and requires player initiative to check the inside of the hut. The next areas are easier as there is only really one way to go but the keep does have a slightly hidden standard that some players initially walked past.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 15

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-15) shows that the players did enjoy exploring the world. I believe one of the factors for this was that although the other areas were mostly blocked off from sight, the players could still see glimpses of them from other parts of the world which teased them of things to come and made them more interested to explore.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 16

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Path forwards blocked?</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Pull the lever...</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>…and the gate will open</p></figcaption></figure>

The gates scattered around the world can each be opened by pulling a lever. These levers require the player to run towards dangerous areas in order to discover them.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

## Non-Gameplay

| 17 | Game can be saved, creating a file on the computer which the game can read to restore that game state at any time. | Not achieved                                                                                                                                  |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 18 | Game has a functional title screen that allows launching the game based of a specific save file.                   | [Cycle 10 - Main Menu & UI](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md)                                                                          |
| 19 | Game has an options menu that lets the player configure certain settings.                                          | Not achieved                                                                                                                                  |
| 20 | UI is neatly and logically laid out. The inventory UI allows players to find out what items do easily.             | [Cycle 10 - Main Menu & UI](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md), [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#effective)    |
| 21 | Game menu is pleasing to look at.                                                                                  | [Cycle 10 - Main Menu & UI](../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md), [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-22) |
| 22 | The game fits a Pegi rating of 12                                                                                  | [Usability Testing](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-22)                                                                       |

### Criterion 17

I wanted to be able to have a way to recover a game between playing sessions to continue where the player left off but I never had time to implement this system. JavaScript has no way to download files automatically into a computer because that would be a huge security risk so I planned to use a password style system that many flash games used where upon leaving the game the player would be asked to remember a password that when entered later on would create a version of the game that is exactly as they left it.&#x20;

I was able to get a form of saving where the player can save their progress within a play session but I would have liked to also have saving between play sessions.

<mark style="background-color:red;">Failure</mark>

### Criterion 18



The title screen is able to launch the game by pressing the 'Start Game' button. As explained in criterion 17, I was not able to get between play session saves so I did not add a button to load a save.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 19

Due to the same time related issues that plagued the rest of the project, the options menu was the first feature I decided to cut out as, although useful, it was not a vital part of gameplay.

<mark style="background-color:red;">Failure</mark>

### Criterion 20

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#effective) show that the players agree the UI is simple and readable. For the most of gameplay it consists of a single red bar in the top left hand corner that scales its length with the player's health, showing them how much health they have left. The health bar has a darker background that does not move, showing the player how much health from their maximum they are. If present, there is also a boss health bar to show the player how much health the boss has left.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 21

// gif of main menu animation?

[This question](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#effective) shows that the players liked the main menu and found it easy to navigate. This could be due to its simple design and fluid animations, which some players said that they enjoyed.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>

### Criterion 22

This question agrees that the game is appropriate for a Pegi 12 rating. The art of the game is 'low poly' which compromises detail and therefore the scenes that could be disturbing, violent or gory are much less so and more appropriate for a younger audience.

<mark style="background-color:green;">Success</mark>
