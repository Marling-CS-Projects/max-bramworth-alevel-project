# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* The game is short, takes about four and a half mins to complete about half the game time is spent of the boss.
* The graphics and animations are basic. The player and enemy models stand in a static 'A' pose for the entirety of the game.
* Platforms are limited to PC only. Console is a large market for souls-like games and the game requires a keyboard and mouse to play.
* Performance is limited by browser and hardware. The game's models are the majority of what the loading time is spent on. Some devices and browsers may cause the game to load slower.
* The game has no audio. Sound is a very big part of video games and my game does not have any. Audio could have been used to set the tone with music or to make combat feel better.

### Game Length



## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

The game has several bugs that need to be addressed. They are as follows:

* A platform that enemies get sucked into.
* Invisible triggers block enemy line of sight.
* Walking out of the boss room when the boss is dead reactivates his UI.
* The gate to the chapel can be jumped over, skipping the requirement to pull the Greymarsh lever. It can also suck the player in on contact.
* Attacking at the apex of a jump freezes the player.
* The fallen templar in the chapel sometimes leaves his room, chasing the player. He also gets twice as fast every time the player dies.
