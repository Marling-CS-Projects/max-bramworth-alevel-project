# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* The game is short, takes about four and a half mins to complete about half the game time is spent of the boss.
* The graphics and animations are basic. The player and enemy models stand in a static 'A' pose for the entirety of the game.
* Platforms are limited to PC only. Console is a large market for souls-like games and the game requires a keyboard and mouse to play.
* Performance is limited by browser and hardware. The game's models are the majority of what the loading time is spent on. Some devices and browsers may cause the game to load slower.

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

The game has several bugs that need to be addressed. They are as follows:

* A platform that enemies get sucked into.
* Invisible triggers block enemy line of sight.
* Walking out of the boss room when the boss is dead reactivates his UI.
* The gate to the chapel can be jumped over, the player can then repeatedly press roll in order to escape out the other side, skipping the requirement to pull the Greymarsh lever.
* Attacking while falling from a jump freezes the player.
* The fallen templar in the chapel sometimes leaves his room, chasing the player. He also gets twice as fast every time the player dies.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

#### Standalone Application

#### Graphics

#### World size
