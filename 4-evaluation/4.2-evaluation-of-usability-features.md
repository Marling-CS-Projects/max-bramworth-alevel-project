### Feature 1

The way forwards was often hinted by a change in the world's visual design and areas that were not to be accessed yet were sealed off with a gate. Where to go was ultimately for the the player to discover but only one part opened at a time and parts of the world frequently give hints on where to go next e.g. the exit from the fallen capital directly faces the gate to the undying keep as it opens.

### Feature 2

All enemies attacks have telegraphing to indicate when and in what direction they will attack. Enemies with multiple attacks have different telegraphs per attack so they player can tell what attack to expect if they have seen that telegraph before. The grey knight enemies do fail in this aspect however as both of their attacks have the same telegraph animation with the only difference being the time the telegraph takes, which is not a perfectly reliable way to predict an attack. The final boss' sweep and stab also suffer from this issue but it is less severe as those attacks are very similar in manner and can be predicted by knowing his attack patterns.

### Feature 3

The UI for most of gameplay is a single red bar whose length is proportional to the player's remaining health. It also has a background of a darker colour that does not change length, allowing the player to see how much health they have lost.&#x20;

### Feature 4

The distinct layout and visual identity of each of the areas makes it easy for the player to know where they are. The swamp is green, blue and very open, the capital is grey, brown and has a towering buildings and the keep is grey and very enclosed. From the starting swamp the player is able to see all of the future areas they will visit so they know from the start where to go.
